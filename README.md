## Animation conventions

- Markup opts into scroll reveals with `data-anim="fade|stagger|lines|clip|draw|count"`; `MotionScope` wraps each page so reveals start only after hydration.
- Component choreography uses `useMotion(ref, ({ motion, desktop }) => …)` — a `gsap.matchMedia` context that reverts on unmount and when reduced-motion changes.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables Lenis and every tween; content is never hidden without JavaScript.

## Adding sitemap pages

Navigation lists every sitemap slug, but the header, mega menus and footer only link to built routes. A page is built once it is in `SITE_PAGES` (`src/content/site/index.ts`) and `SitePage` has a layout for it.

## Open items

- The demo form is not connected yet: submit stays disabled with a notice until request delivery and the privacy notice are confirmed.
- The OpenDental page (`/technology/opendental/`) is not built yet, so it isn't linked.
